Final-Project
=============

Roxanna and Afroze
This project is based on potential jobs offered in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields.  There are three jobs listed for each section which describe the salary, degree's required, and skills needed when on the job. We wanted to stick with flat design as the main theme because it is easier to read an navigate.  In terms of color choice oranges and grays are listed as industrial colors, which fits in with the theme of jobs in technical and mathematical fields.  As far as who did what Roxanna designed it and made all of the illustrator files, Afroze had an input as well in the design and did all of the coding.
